## Program Details


> ### Where Can AI Take Education by 2030
> 
> <cite>Tom Mitchell, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University</cite>

{% highlight html %}
Abstract: The past decade has put us in a unique position with respect to AI and Education: AI has made surprisingly rapid progress, while the use of computers in education has finally become mainstream.   The thesis of this talk is that if there is ever going to be a decade in which AI revolutionizes education, it will be the coming decade.  We'll look at the state of the art, and speculate where this could lead us during the 2020's, in three distinct areas:  (1) educational settings where single students interact with single computers, (2) settings where the interaction involves a student-computer-teacher triangle, and (3) settings where students work in teams with an AI assistant also present.  This talk may well raise more questions than it answers, so we'll leave plenty of time for discussion.

Bio: Tom M. Mitchell is the Founders University Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, where he founded the world's first Machine Learning Department.   His research interests range include machine learning, artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, and the impact of AI on society.   His current focus is AI and education, where he has worked closely with organizations that field computer learning environments to millions of students, including Squirrel AI, and CK12.org.   He has testified to the U.S. Congressional Research Service, and the U.S. House Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs regarding potential uses and impacts of artificial intelligence, and is currently co-chairing a U.S. National Academies study on AI and the future of work.  Mitchell is an elected member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Fellow and Past President of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).

> ### From Autonomy to Synergy: Envisioning Next Generation Human-AI Partnerships
> 
> <cite>Sidney K. D’Mello, University of Colorado Boulder</cite>

{% highlight html %}
Abstract: I'll describe a vision for AI, beyond a cold, autonomous agent working for humans to a socio-technical synergistic partnership with humans. I'll highlight these ideas in the context of the NSF National AI Institute for Student AI Teaming (www.isat.ai), which brings together a geographically distributed team of researchers with K-12 partners to reframe the role of AI in education, moving from a facilitator of personalized one-on-one learning, to a social, collaborative partner which helps students and teachers work and learn more effectively, engagingly, and equitably. The talk will highlight insights and technologies at the intersection of the Institute's three research strands: (1) foundational AI to understand and facilitate conversations; (2) orchestrating classroom interactions with AI; and (3) broadening participation with curriculum co-design. I'll contextualize the research within our commitment to responsible innovation and polycultural approaches for developing ethical AI technologies. 

Bio: Sidney D'Mello (PhD in Computer Science) is a Professor in the Institute of Cognitive Science and Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. He is interested in the dynamic interplay between cognition and emotion while individuals and groups engage in complex real-world activities. He applies insights gleaned from this basic research program to develop intelligent technologies that help people achieve to their fullest potential by coordinating what they think and feel with what they know and do. D'Mello has co-edited seven books and has published more than 300 journal papers, book chapters, and conference proceedings. His research has received 17 awards at international conferences and has been funded by numerous grants. D'Mello serves(d) as Associate Editor and on the Editorial Boards of 11 journals. He leads the NSF National Institute for Student-Agent Teaming (2020-2025), which aims to develop AI technologies to facilitate rich socio-collaborative learning experiences for all students.

## Workshop Description


In this workshop, we invited AIED enthusiasts from all around the world through the following **three different channels**:

* First, we invited established researchers in the AIED community to give a <span style="color:red">broad talk</span> that (1) describes a vision for bridging AIED communities; (2) summarizes a well-developed AIED research area; or (3) presents promising ideas and visions for new AIED research directions. 

* Second, we called for <span style="color:red">regular workshop paper submissions</span> and <span style="color:red">cross-submissions</span> (papers that have appeared in or submitted to alternative venues) related to a broad range of AI domains for education. 

* Third, we hosted a <span style="color:red">global challenge</span> on Codalab for a fair comparison of state-of-the-art **Knowledge Tracing** models and invited technical reports from winning teams. 



### Regular Workshop Paper Submission

We invite high-quality paper submissions of theoretical and experimental nature on the broad AIED topics. The workshop solicits **4-7 pages double-blind** paper submissions from participants. Submissions of the following flavors will be sought: (1) research ideas, (2) case studies (or deployed projects), (3) review papers, (4) best practice papers, and (5) lessons learned. The format is the standard double-column [AAAI Proceedings Style](https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AnonymousSubmission23.zip). All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Some will be selected for spotlight talks, and some for the poster session.



### Cross-submissions 

In addition to previously unpublished work, we invite papers on relevant topics which have appeared in alternative venues (such as other ML or AIED conferences). Accepted cross-submissions will be presented as 15-min oral presentations, with an indication of the original venue. Selection of cross-submissions will be determined solely by the organizing committee. There will be no regular paper reviews for cross submissions. Please use the **original paper format** when submitting to the cross-submission track.


### Submission Website

Submission website: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aaai2023ai4edu](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aaai2023ai4edu). The submission AUTHOR KIT can be found at [https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AnonymousSubmission23.zip](https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AnonymousSubmission23.zip).


### Global Knowledge Tracing Challenge

In this competition, we would like to call for researchers and practitioners worldwide to investigate the opportunities of **improving the student assessment performance via knowledge tracing approaches with rich side information**.
