## Workshop Description


In this workshop, we invited AIED enthusiasts from all around the world through the following **three different channels**:

* First, we invited established researchers in the AIED community to give a <span style="color:red">broad talk</span> that (1) describes a vision for bridging AIED communities; (2) summarizes a well-developed AIED research area; or (3) presents promising ideas and visions for new AIED research directions. 

* Second, we called for <span style="color:red">regular workshop paper submissions</span> and <span style="color:red">cross-submissions</span> (papers that have appeared in or submitted to alternative venues) related to a broad range of AI domains for education. 

* Third, we hosted a <span style="color:red">global challenge</span> on Codalab for a fair comparison of state-of-the-art **Knowledge Tracing** models and invited technical reports from winning teams. 



### Regular Workshop Paper Submission

We invite high-quality paper submissions of theoretical and experimental nature on the broad AIED topics. The workshop solicits **4-7 pages double-blind** paper submissions from participants. Submissions of the following flavors will be sought: (1) research ideas, (2) case studies (or deployed projects), (3) review papers, (4) best practice papers, and (5) lessons learned. The format is the standard double-column [AAAI Proceedings Style](https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AnonymousSubmission23.zip). All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Some will be selected for spotlight talks, and some for the poster session.



### Cross-submissions 

In addition to previously unpublished work, we invite papers on relevant topics which have appeared in alternative venues (such as other ML or AIED conferences). Accepted cross-submissions will be presented as 15-min oral presentations, with an indication of the original venue. Selection of cross-submissions will be determined solely by the organizing committee. There will be no regular paper reviews for cross submissions. Please use the **original paper format** when submitting to the cross-submission track.


### Submission Website

### Global Knowledge Tracing Challenge

In this competition, we would like to call for researchers and practitioners worldwide to investigate the opportunities of **improving the student assessment performance via knowledge tracing approaches with rich side information**.
