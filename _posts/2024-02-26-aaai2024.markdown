# Workshop Overview

This two-day workshop explores the innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically generative-AI (GenAI), in educational applications, and discusses the related ethical implications of responsible-AI (RAI). Over two days, attendees will examine GenAI technologies, potential vulnerabilities, and the development of RAI standards in an educational context. Through a variety of formats like papers, demonstrations, posters, a global competition on Math reasoning, and opportunities to hear experts and representatives from various communities, participants will explore AI's impact on instruction quality, learner outcomes, and ethics. This workshop ultimately aims to inspire novel ideas, foster partnerships, and navigate the ethical complexities of AI in education. 

# Topics of interest

**Day 1.** Cognitive and learning science principles for improving genAI-based learning frameworks and tutoring systems; Mitigating “hallucinations” in large language models (LLMs) and improving factual validity for education; Improving mathematical and scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs; Methods and metrics for evaluating GenAI content; AI-based methods to evaluate students, monitor their progress and personalize their education; Analyses, studies, and solutions for preserving academic integrity in the abundance of GenAI models and generated educational content; Benchmark datasets for genAI applications in education; Next generation infrastructure to support research on GenAI for education


**Day 2.** Responsible AI (RAI; e.g., Fairness, Accountability, Interpretability, and Transparency) for consequential decision-making in education (e.g. admissions, early warning systems, grading); Methodological contributions and impact of responsible AI in education, including and not restricted to generative modeling, predictive modeling, causal inference, reinforcement learning, and data collection; AI for better student outcomes: applications that use AI to enhance educational interventions under resource constraints and inequity; Privacy, security, and AI Regulation in education equity, pipelines, and representation; surveillance; platform governance; regulating large/foundation models in education settings; Social and cultural impacts of AI in education; historical perspectives and critical theory

# Format of Workshop

We have a two-day workshop with distinct themes and events on each day. Day 1 will focus on innovations in AI for education specifically highlighting GenAI and a variety of different events including keynotes, invited presentations/posters/demos, a debate all with representation from research and allied communities, and finally, a global challenge on math reasoning. Day 2 will highlight topics on responsibility in AI for education with a keynote, a stellar lineup of invited speakers, a moderated discussion session, expert panels highlighting critical issues in responsible AI, spotlight talks, and a poster session to highlight accepted papers. Participants will be encouraged to think critically, ask questions, identify edge cases for demos, and come together to brainstorm solutions.

# Call for Submissions

We welcome different kinds of submissions: 

- **Short papers (2 pages + references).** Demo papers, Work-in-progress papers. These submissions will be exhibited as posters or demonstrations. 

- **Full papers (up to 6 pages + references).** Novel research papers, Appraisal papers of existing methods and tools (e.g., lessons learned), Benchmark datasets highlighting the application of GenAI, Evaluatory papers that revisit the validity of domain assumptions

## Submission Process

All submissions must be made through the [OpenReview portal for the workshop](https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org/2024/Workshop/AI4ED){:target="_blank"}. Authors must have an OpenReview account in order to make submissions. All submissions must follow the [PMLR style template](https://rice.box.com/s/4itqz94qaxxkycq0r6zqla186pz9ed3y){:target="_blank"}.

### Submission Guidelines
Workshop submissions are anonymous and must conform to the instructions (detailed below) for double-blind review. The authors must remove all author and affiliation information from their submission for review and may replace it with other information, such as paper number and keywords. Submissions may consist of up to 6 pages of technical content plus additional pages solely for references; acknowledgments should be omitted from papers submitted for review.
Only PDF files are required at the time of submission for review; authors will additionally need to submit paper source files if their paper is accepted for publication.

[> Access the OpenReview Submission Portal](https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org/2024/Workshop/AI4ED){:target="_blank"}

#### Submission Limit per Author
Each individual author is limited to no more than a combined limit of 5 submissions to the AI4ED-AAAI24 workshop (including papers in the Innovation and Responsible AI tracks) and authors may not be added to papers following submission (see below for policies about author changes).

#### Guidelines for Changes to Titles/Authors after Submissions
MODIFICATIONS TO SUBMISSIONS ARE ONLY ALLOWED UNTIL SUBMISSION DEADLINE (November 23, 2023). No exceptions will be granted. Please see the full policy on [Paper Modification Guidelines](https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/paper-modification-guidelines/).

#### Policy Concerning Multiple Submissions to Conferences or Journals
This workshop will not consider any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review or has already been published or accepted for publication in any archival venue such as a journal or a conference (workshops and preprint servers such as arXiv are acceptable). Authors are free to retract a submission from a venue with a concurrent review process (e.g., from NeurIPS-23) and submit the same work to the AI4ED-AAAI24 workshop  as a full paper, provided that this retraction occurs before the AI4ED-AAAI-24 submission. Authors must confirm at the time of submission that the paper is not under review at another archival conference or journal.
Once they have made a submission to the workshop, authors may not submit the same paper to another archival conference or journal until they receive an accept/reject decision from AI4ED-AAAI24 or they withdraw their submission from AI4ED-AAAI-24. In some cases, it may require a judgment call to determine whether two concurrent submissions constitute a violation of AAAI’s multiple submission policy. If a concern is raised about the similarity of two non-identical submissions, at least three people will inspect whatever information is available about both submissions. If they all agree that the simultaneous submission has excessive technical overlap, the paper will be summarily rejected and the organizers of the other conference will be informed about AAAI’s decision. As with all summary rejects, such decisions are final.

#### Citation and Comparison
Papers are expected to cite those refereed publications most relevant to their content, but authors are excused for not knowing about all non-refereed work (e.g, appearing on arXiv). Nevertheless, in cases where such prior work is widely known in the field, its existence may be considered by reviewers in assessing a submission’s novelty. Papers published less than two months before the regular paper submission deadline (November 23, 2023) are considered contemporaneous to all AAAI-24 submissions; authors are not obliged to address such papers (though, especially for the camera-ready versions of accepted papers, authors are encouraged to do so).

#### Reproducibility Guidelines
Authors must complete a [reproducibility checklist](https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/reproducibility-checklist/) at the time of paper submission, which outlines how to reproduce the results of the submission. These responses will become part of each paper submission and will be shared with reviewers. Information related to reproducing experimental results described in the submission may be included in the main paper or the Code and Data Appendix, as appropriate. Further technical details (proofs, descriptions of assumptions, algorithm pseudocode) may be included in the Technical Appendix. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include detailed information about each reproducibility criterion as part of their Technical Appendix. Reviewers will be asked to assess the degree to which the results reported in a paper are reproducible, and this assessment will be weighed when making final decisions about each paper.

#### Ethics Policy
All AAAI authors and reviewers are required to honor the [AAAI Publications Ethics and Malpractice Statement](http://aaai.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Publications_Ethics_and_Malpractice_Statement.pdf), as well as the [AAAI Code of Professional Conduct](https://aaai.org/Conferences/code-of-ethics-and-conduct.php). A paper may be rejected if an author is found to violate the AAAI Publications Ethics and Malpractice Statement or the AAAI Code of Professional Conduct.
Demonstrations
During paper submission, authors will be able to express interest in giving a public demo of the systems described in the paper. Based on these expressions of interest and reviews, papers will be selected to participate in a demonstration session, which will happen in addition to technical talks and posters.
