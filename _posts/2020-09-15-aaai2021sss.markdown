## Introduction

Technology has transformed over the last few years, turning from futuristic ideas into today’s reality. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of these transformative technologies that is now achieving great successes in various real-world applications and made our life more convenient and safe. AI is now shaping the way businesses, governments, and educational institutions do things and is making its way into K-12 classrooms, schools and districts across many countries.

In fact, the increasingly digitalized education tools and the popularity of online learning have produced an unprecedented amount of data that provides us with invaluable opportunities for applying AI in K-12 education. Recent years have witnessed growing efforts from AI research community devoted to advancing our education and promising results have been obtained in solving various critical problems in K-12 education. For examples, AI tools are built to ease the workload for teachers. Instead of grading each piece of work individually, which can take up a bulk of extra time, intelligent scoring tools allow teachers the ability to have their students work automatically graded. What's more, various AI based models are trained on massive student behavioral and exercise data to have the ability to take note of a student’s strengths and weaknesses, identifying where they may be struggling. These models can also generate instant feedback to instructors and help them to improve their teaching effectiveness. 

Despite gratifying achievements have demonstrated the great potential and bright development prospect of introducing AI in K-12 education, developing and applying AI technologies to educational practice is fraught with its unique challenges, including, but not limited to, extreme data sparsity, lack of labeled data, and privacy issues. Hence, this symposium will focus on introducing research progress on applying AI to K-12 education and discussing recent advances of handling challenges encountered in AI educational practice. The proposed symposium builds upon our continued efforts ([AAAI'20 workshop](http://ai4ed.cc/workshops/aaai2020), [IJCAI'20 tutorial](http://ai4ed.cc/tutorials/ijcai2020), [KDD'20 tutorial](http://ai4ed.cc/tutorials/kdd2020)) in bringing the AI community members together for the above-mentioned themes. This symposium will bring together AI researchers, learning scientists, educators and policymakers to exchange problems and solutions and build possible collaborations in the future.


## Symposium Description

### Topics

We encourage keynote speeches on a broad range of AI domains for K-12 education. Topics of interest include  (in no particular order) but are not limited to following:

* Emerging technologies in K-12 education
* Evaluation of K-12 education technologies
* Immersive learning and multimedia applications
* Implications of big data in K-12 education
* Self-adaptive learning
* Individual and personalized K-12 education
* Intelligent learning systems
* Intelligent tutoring and monitoring systems
* Automatic assessment in K-12 education
* Automated grading of assignments
* Automated feedback and recommendations
* Big data analytics for K-12 education
* Analysis of communities of learning
* Computer-aided assessment
* Course development techniques
* Data analytics \& big data in K-12 education
* Mining and web mining in K-12 education
* Learning tools experiences and cases of study
* Social media in K-12 education
* Smart K-12 education
* Digital libraries for learning
* K-12 education analytic approaches, methods, and tools
* Knowledge management for learning
* Learning analytics and K-12 educational data mining
* Learning technology for lifelong learning
* Tracking learning activities
* Uses of multimedia for K-12 education
* Wearable computing technology in e-learning
* Smart classroom
* Dropout prediction
* Knowledge tracing

### Submissions

The symposium solicits paper submissions from participants (2–6 pages). Abstracts of the following flavors will be sought: 

1. research ideas
2. case studies (or deployed projects)
3. review papers
4. best practice papers
5. lessons learned. 

The format is the standard double-column AAAI Proceedings Style. 

We will encourage submissions of works-in-progress and extended abstracts, in addition to full length papers. All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Some will be selected for spotlight talks, and some for the poster session. 

## Tentative Schedule

We propose **two-day** symposium with the following sessions:

* Oral presentations session: 10 minute presentation for oral papers.
* Poster session: One poster session of all accepted papers which leads for interaction and personal feedback to the research.
* Keynotes and invited talks: Several keynotes and invited talks by leading researchers in the area will be presented.
* Panel discussion: Interactive Q\&A session with a panel of leading researchers

A poster session has been a highly effective form of communicating early stage research, compared to full presentations. In combination with oral representations, the accepted papers will get audience attention and lead to a very interactive, feedback based poster session.

Day 1 activities will be centered around the theme of how can **AI to empower K-12 education** (in general)? While day 2 activities will focus on two topics of **NLP Innovation in Educational Applications** and **Innovative Industrial AI Applications in Education**.
