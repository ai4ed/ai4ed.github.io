## Talk Details


> ### Human-Centered AI in AI-ED
> 
> <cite>Peter Brusilovsky</cite>

{% highlight html %}
Abstract: In recent years, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies expanded to many areas directly affecting the lives of millions. AI-based approaches advise human decision-makers who should be released on bail, whether it is a good time to discharge a patient from a hospital and whether a specific student is at risk to fail a course. Such extensive use in AI in decision making came with a range of protentional problems that have been extensively studied over the last few years. Recognition of these problems motivated a rapid rise of research on “human-centered AI”, which attempted to address and minimize the negative effects of using AI technologies. The majority of work on human-centered AI focus on various types of Human-AI collaboration through such technologies as transparency, explainability, and user control. In my talk, I will review how the ideas of Human-AI collaboration, transparency, explainability, and user control have been used in educational applications of AI in the past and will discuss now new ideas in this research area developed outside of AI-Ed could be creatively applied in educational context.

> ### Audio-based Collaboration Detection for Improving FACT, a Classroom Orchestrating System
> 
> <cite>Bahar Shahrokhian, Jon Wetzel, Kurt VanLehn</cite>

{% highlight html %}
Abstract: An intelligent classroom orchestration System should act like an automated teaching assistant that helps teachers in providing relevant, timely help.  This is especially important when teachers want small groups of students to work together collaboratively rather than work separately or have one student do all the work.  Teachers cannot monitor all groups simultaneously and they can only visit one group at a time.  FACT is like an intelligent tutoring system for middle-school math  in that it understands the tasks students are doing so it can identify errors and thus offer feedback and advice.  Unlike most tutoring systems, FACT keeps the teacher in the loop by suggesting groups to visit, errors to address and even conversation openers.  Recently, FACT gained the ability to discriminate collaborating groups from non-collaborating groups by monitoring each group member's speech and actions.  This talk will describe FACT and our recent work on using speech and log data to detect collaboration. 

Bio: Bahar Shahrokhian is currently working toward obtaining her doctoral degree in Computer Engineering from Arizona State University. Her research focuses on detecting collaboration among students in a classroom using their speech.

> ### The Need and Challenge of Trustworthy AI For Next-generation Education Systems That Engage Humans as Partners in Teaching and Learning
> 
> <cite>Richard Tong</cite>

{% highlight html %}
Abstract: The potential applications of artificial intelligence to educational settings are vast. However, we argue that developers must first build trust in educational technologies to realize their potential in society. This view emerges from the interaction of three factors: 1) the general need to address the concerns surrounding costs and benefits of technological applications as they are adopted, 2) the diversity of important views and dimensions regarding education and pedagogy, and 3) the necessity for technology to bear important accountability in real-time decisioning in many educational applications. We propose that in educational AI applications, Human-in-the-loop (HITL) approaches that engage both learners and educators in an AI-involved teaching process presents an opportunity to build trust in the efficacy of educational AI applications, on top of increasing the quality of education delivered, by allowing them to participate actively in the process of educational decision making. Although nascent forms of HITL processes in educational technology exist, developing AI systems with truly human-involved collaborative teaching and learning requires surmounting several key challenges: 1) Designing a reliable and practical process to handle variation in the quality of human input and dynamic teaching/learning interaction 2) Developing a shared mental model of learning between humans and AI systems. We review some of the state of the art approaches in this research and development area, examine some promising Human-AI collaboration use cases in adaptive instructional system settings, and also recommend practical implementation of IEEE artificial intelligence and learning technology standards that help to advance this endeavor.

> ### Neural Approaches to Course Articulation and Personalized Degree Planning in Higher Education
> 
> <cite>Zach Pardos</cite>

{% highlight html %}
Abstract: Determining which course at one institution is academically equivalent to a course at another institution, called "articulation," can be an intractable task when attempting to make and maintain equivalencies precisely between even a small set of institutions. These equivalencies are, however, critical to socio-economic mobility in America, allowing students to transfer from 2-year to 4-year schools where they enjoy greater career opportunities. In this talk, I will present research on using neural machine translation techniques to scale articulation recommendation by leveraging course catalog descriptions complimented by information contained within historic enrollment patterns to infer cross-institutional equivalencies. For these algorithmically created pathways to have an effect; however, recommender systems must be built to help students traverse them.

In the second part of the talk, I will present work on a novel algorithm for powering degree planning recommender systems. The algorithm focuses on the task of multiple consecutive basket recommendation, with semesters representing baskets in the higher education domain. Our model, PLAN-BERT (published at AAAI21), makes novel modifications to the canonical language model architecture to generate a multi-semester plan personalized to a student's past course taking and specified future courses of interest. Our offline analysis consists of 15 million historic course enrollments at 20 institutions and an online evaluation conducted at one of the institutions. In the online evaluation, PLAN-BERT was rated strongest in student perceptions of personalization compared to competitive baselines and equaled the rating of plans generated by student peers.

Bio: Zach Pardos is an Associate Professor at UC Berkeley studying adaptive learning and AI in the Graduate School of Education.

## Introduction

Technology has transformed over the last few years, turning from futuristic ideas into today's reality. AI is one of these transformative technologies that is now achieving great successes in various real-world applications and making our life more convenient and safe. AI is now shaping the way businesses, governments, and educational institutions doing things and is making its way into classrooms, schools and districts across many countries.

In fact, the increasingly digitalized education tools and the popularity of online learning have produced an unprecedented amount of data that provides us with invaluable opportunities for applying AI in education. Recent years have witnessed growing efforts from AI research community devoted to advancing our education and promising results have been obtained in solving various critical problems in education. For examples, AI tools are built to ease the workload for teachers. Instead of grading each piece of work individually, which can take up a bulk of extra time, intelligent scoring tools allow teachers the ability to have their students work automatically graded. In the coronoavirus era, requiring many schools to move to online learning, the ability to give feedback at scale could provide needed support to teachers. What's more, various AI based models are trained on massive student behavioral and exercise data to have the ability to take note of a student's strengths and weaknesses, identifying where they may be struggling. These models can also generate instant feedback to instructors and help them to improve their teaching effectiveness. Furthermore, leveraging AI to connect disparate social networks among teachers, we may be able to provide greater resources for their planning, which have been shown to significantly effect students' achievement.


Despite gratifying achievements have demonstrated the great potential and bright development prospect of introducing AI in education, developing and applying AI technologies to educational practice is fraught with its unique challenges, including, but not limited to, extreme data sparsity, lack of labeled data, and privacy issues. Hence, this workshop will focus on introducing research progress on applying AI to education and discussing recent advances of handling challenges encountered in AI educational practice.
