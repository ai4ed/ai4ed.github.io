## Introduction

Technology has transformed over the last few years, turning from futuristic ideas into today’s reality. AI is one of these transformative technologies that is now achieving great successes in various real-world applications and making our life more convenient and safe. AI is now shaping the way businesses, governments, and educational institutions doing things and is making its way into classrooms, schools and districts across many countries.

In fact, the increasingly digitalized education tools and the popularity of online learning have produced an unprecedented amount of data that provides us with invaluable opportunities for applying AI in education. Recent years have witnessed growing efforts from AI research community devoted to advancing our education and promising results have been obtained in solving various critical problems in education. For examples, AI tools are built to ease the workload for teachers. Instead of grading each piece of work individually, which can take up a bulk of extra time, intelligent scoring tools allow teachers the ability to have their students work automatically graded. In the coronoavirus era, requiring many schools to move to online learning, the ability to give feedback at scale could provide needed support to teachers. What's more, various AI based models are trained on massive student behavioral and exercise data to have the ability to take note of a student’s strengths and weaknesses, identifying where they may be struggling. These models can also generate instant feedback to instructors and help them to improve their teaching effectiveness. Furthermore, leveraging AI to connect disparate social networks among teachers, we may be able to provide greater resources for their planning, which have been shown to significantly effect students' achievement.


Despite gratifying achievements have demonstrated the great potential and bright development prospect of introducing AI in education, developing and applying AI technologies to educational practice is fraught with its unique challenges, including, but not limited to, extreme data sparsity, lack of labeled data, and privacy issues. Hence, this workshop will focus on introducing research progress on applying AI to education and discussing recent advances of handling challenges encountered in AI educational practice.

## Submission

The workshop solicits paper submissions from participants (2–6 pages **with unlimited references** and **single blind**). Abstracts of the following flavors will be sought: (1) research ideas, (2) case studies (or deployed projects), (3) review papers, (4) best practice papers, and (5) lessons learned. The format is the standard double-column AAAI proceedings style. All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Some will be selected for spotlight talks, and some for the poster session.
