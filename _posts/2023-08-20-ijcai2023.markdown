## Overview

Multimodal Reasoning is an emerging research area that aims to enable intelligent systems to reason and learn from information obtained from various modalities, such as language, images, videos, and sensor data. This symposium focuses on exploring different aspects of multimodal reasoning, including combining multimodal learners, language models, and attention mechanisms, evaluating the effectiveness of transfer learning and pre-training in multimodal reasoning, and examining the impact of data augmentation techniques. Additionally, we will explore how multimodal reasoning can be used to improve educational outcomes, healthcare outcomes, and other information processing tasks.
