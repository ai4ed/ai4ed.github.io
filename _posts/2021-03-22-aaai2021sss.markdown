## Introduction

Technology has transformed over the last few years, turning from futuristic ideas into today’s reality. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of these transformative technologies that is now achieving great successes in various real-world applications and made our life more convenient and safe. AI is now shaping the way businesses, governments, and educational institutions do things and is making its way into K-12 classrooms, schools and districts across many countries.

In fact, the increasingly digitalized education tools and the popularity of online learning have produced an unprecedented amount of data that provides us with invaluable opportunities for applying AI in K-12 education. Recent years have witnessed growing efforts from AI research community devoted to advancing our education and promising results have been obtained in solving various critical problems in K-12 education. For examples, AI tools are built to ease the workload for teachers. Instead of grading each piece of work individually, which can take up a bulk of extra time, intelligent scoring tools allow teachers the ability to have their students work automatically graded. What's more, various AI based models are trained on massive student behavioral and exercise data to have the ability to take note of a student’s strengths and weaknesses, identifying where they may be struggling. These models can also generate instant feedback to instructors and help them to improve their teaching effectiveness. 

Despite gratifying achievements have demonstrated the great potential and bright development prospect of introducing AI in K-12 education, developing and applying AI technologies to educational practice is fraught with its unique challenges, including, but not limited to, extreme data sparsity, lack of labeled data, and privacy issues. Hence, this symposium will focus on introducing research progress on applying AI to K-12 education and discussing recent advances of handling challenges encountered in AI educational practice. The proposed symposium builds upon our continued efforts ([AAAI'20 workshop](http://ai4ed.cc/workshops/aaai2020), [IJCAI'20 tutorial](http://ai4ed.cc/tutorials/ijcai2020), [KDD'20 tutorial](http://ai4ed.cc/tutorials/kdd2020)) in bringing the AI community members together for the above-mentioned themes. This symposium will bring together AI researchers, learning scientists, educators and policymakers to exchange problems and solutions and build possible collaborations in the future.



## Symposium Schedule

Day 1 activities will be centered around the theme of how can **AI to empower K-12 education** (in general)? While day 2 activities will focus on two topics of **NLP Innovation in Educational Applications** and **Innovative Industrial AI Applications in Education**.

## Talk Details

> ### AI-Driven Robot for Education
> 
> <cite>Dr. Yu Lv, Beijing Normal University</cite>

{% highlight html %}
Abstract: In this talk, I introduce two different AI-driven robots for the education purposes. The first robot mainly targets on better motivating learners and optimizing the learning experiments for subject learning. The second one focuses on providing the intelligent dialogue service to help young teachers and parents to solve their problems for moral education. The designed robots adopt the latest AI technologies, typically including natural language processing, machine learning and affective computing, and have been deployed in practical learning context.
