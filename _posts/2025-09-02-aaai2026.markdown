## Motivation

In the era of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, multimodal AI systems — from large foundational models to efficient, task-specific agents - are reshaping how machines understand and generate human-like interactions across text, vision, audio, and beyond. While Large Language Model (LLM) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offer unprecedented capabilities for personalization and automation in education, emerging paradigms such as Agentic AI and compact, efficient models are demonstrating remarkable efficacy in targeted educational tasks — often with greater deployability, interpretability, and alignment with real-world constraints.

As these diverse AI approaches begin to permeate the educational landscape, they offer complementary pathways to enhance personalized learning, support diverse learner needs, and automate complex instructional tasks — while also raising critical questions about equity, transparency, and pedagogical alignment.

This workshop seeks to bring together leading researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to explore the multifaceted potentials and pressing challenges of applying multimodal and agentic AI systems — ranging from large foundational models to efficient, task-oriented agents — in education. By fostering dialogue across disciplines, the event aims to chart a roadmap for responsible innovation, ensuring that the deployment of these diverse AI approaches not only advances educational outcomes but also aligns with core human values in teaching and learning — including equity, accessibility, and sustainability.


## Opportunities

* **Personalized Multimodal Learning**: LMMs enable highly tailored educational experiences by integrating text, image, audio, and video, supporting diverse learner needs and preferences.
* **Intelligent Content and Feedback Generation**: They can automatically generate high-quality teaching materials, explanations, and formative assessments across modalities.
* **Empowering Teachers and Scaling Quality Instruction**: By assisting in lesson planning, grading, and real-time support, LMMs can augment teacher capacity and democratize access to expert-level instruction.

## Challenges

* **Pedagogical Misalignment and Hallucinations**: LMMs may produce content that is factually incorrect or pedagogically unsound, posing risks in critical educational settings.
* **Bias, Fairness, and Equity**: Unequal performance across languages, cultures, or abilities can reinforce existing disparities if not carefully addressed.
* **Interpretability and Trust**: Educators and stakeholders require transparent, explainable systems to make informed decisions about adoption and use.



## Workshop Description

In this workshop, we will invite AIED enthusiasts and critics as well as AIED designers, providers and practitioners from all around the world through the following **two different channels**:

* First, we will invite established researchers in the AIED community to give a keynote talk that (1) describes a vision for bridging AIED communities; (2) summarizes a well-developed AIED research area; or (3) presents promising ideas and visions for new AIED research directions.

* Second, we will call for regular workshop paper submissions related to a broad range of AI domains for education.


Through these initiatives, we aim to provide a common ground for researchers to share their cutting-edge insights on AIED and encourage the development of practical and large-scale AIED methods of lasting impact.

The workshop solicits **5-7 pages double-blind** paper submissions (with unlimited references) from participants. Submissions of the following flavors will be sought: (1) research ideas, (2) case studies (or deployed projects), (3) review papers, (4) best practice papers, and (5) lessons learned. The format is the standard double-column AAAI Proceedings Style. The style files can be found at [https://aaai.org/authorkit26-1/](https://aaai.org/authorkit26-1/). All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Some will be selected for spotlight talks, and some for the poster session.

Reviewing will be double-blind, so please do not include any self-identifying information in the submission. Double submission is allowed, as **the workshop is non-archival**.
